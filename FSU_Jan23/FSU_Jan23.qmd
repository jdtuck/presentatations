## Introduction
::: {.column width="49.5%"}
- Question: How can we model functions
    - [Can we use the functions to classify diseases?]{.blue}
    - [Can we use them as predictors in a regression model?]{.blue}
    - [Can we calibrate a computer model?]{.blue}
:::

:::
- One problem occurs when performing these types of analysis is that functional data can contain variability in [time]{.alert} (x-direction) and [amplitude]{.alert}  (y-direction)
- How do we characterize and utilize this variability in the models that are constructed from functional data?

## Components of Function Variability
![](figs/function_var.png)

## Functional Data Analysis
- Let $f$ be a real valued-function with the domain $[0,1]$, can be extended to any domain
    - Only functions that are absolutely continuous on $[0,1]$ will be considered
- Let $\Gamma$ be the group of all warping functions
$$ \Gamma = \{\gamma:[0,1]\rightarrow[0,1]|\gamma(0)=0,\gamma(1)=1,~\gamma \mbox{ is a diffeo}\} $$
- It acts on the function space by composition
$$(f,\gamma) = f\circ\gamma$$
- It is common to use the following objective function for alignment
$$\min_{\gamma\in\Gamma}\|f_1\circ\gamma-f_2\|$$
- Note: It is [not a distance]{.alert} function since it is not symmetric.

## Elastic Distance (Fisher-Rao)
Define the Square Root Velocity Function
$$q:[0,1]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^1,~q(t)=sign(\dot{f}(t))\sqrt{|\dot{f}(t)|}$$
Fisher Rao Distance is $\mathbb{L}^2$ in SRVF space
$$d_a(f_1,f_2) = \inf_\gamma\|(q_1\circ\gamma)\sqrt{\dot{\gamma}}-q_2\|$$
Distance is a [proper distance]{.alert}

Can compute distance on warping functions (how much alignment)
$$d_p(\gamma) = \arccos\left(\int_0^1\sqrt{\dot{\gamma}}\,dt\right)$$

## Bayesian Model Calibration

::: {.column width="49.5%"}
- We wish to calibrate a computer model with parameters $\theta$ to an experiment
- Can compute computer model (simulations) over wide range of $\theta$
- The data is functional in nature and has [phase]{.alert} and [amplitude]{.alert} variability
- Utilize elastic metrics in a Bayesian Model Calibration Framework
:::

## Elastic Bayesian Model Calibration
- Decompose observation into aligned functions and warping functions
$$y_i^E(t) = y_i^E(t^*)\circ\gamma_i^E(t)$$
- and decompose the simulations
$$y^M(t,x_j) = y^M(t^*,x_j)\circ\gamma^M(t,x_j)$$
- To facilitate modeling, we transform the warping functions into shooting vector space with
$$v_i^E = \exp_\psi^{-1}\left(\sqrt{\dot{\gamma}_i^E}\right)$$
$$v^M(x) = \exp_\psi^{-1}\left(\sqrt{\dot{\gamma}^M(x)}\right)$$

## Elastic Bayesian Model Calibration
- Calibrate the aligned data and shooting vectors using the following model
$$y^E(t^*) = y^M(t^*,\theta)+\delta_y(t^*)+\epsilon_y(t^*),~\epsilon_y(t^*)\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_y^2I)$$
$$v^E = v^M(\theta) + \delta_v + \epsilon_v,~\epsilon_v\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_v^2I)$$
- Note: The shooting vector will be identity if the data is aligned to the observation (experiment)
- Then if $\theta$ is calibrated correctly the shooting vectors will be identity

## MCMC Sampling
For each experiment the likelihood is a Gaussian likelihood

1. We fit an emulator (Gaussian Process, BASS, MARS) to the simulated data
2. Uniform priors on $\theta$
3. Sample posterior using delayed rejection adaptive Metropolis Hastings
4. Implemented using Impala (LANL) or Dakota (SNL) calibration framework

## Simulation

::: {.column width="49.5%"}

- Simulation study where each function is parameterized Gaussian pdf
- A set of 100 functions were simulated with $\theta_1,\theta_2$ being drawn from a $U[0,1]$
- Third nuisance parameter $\theta_3$ also drawn from $U[0,1]$
:::

$$f_i(t) = \frac{\theta_1}{0.05\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{t-(\sin(2\pi \theta_0^2)/4-\theta_0/10+0.5)}{0.05}\right)^2\right)$$
